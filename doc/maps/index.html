<h1>Map File Format</h1>

Maps are stored in a data/*/maps directory, and must have a filename
ending in ".py". To load a map at the command-line, use the "-m"
option, then give the name of the map without the .py ending. So
something like:

<pre>
GalaxyMage.py -m castle-1
</pre>

Each map file is actually written in the Python language, which is
just done for convenience (it makes loading the maps a snap). So it
might help to get a text editor that supports Python syntax
highlighting, as it will be easier to notice if you make some sort of
error.
<p>
This document walks you through the process of building a map from the
ground up -- starting by specifying tile heights, then adding colors,
textures, and so on. We'll be using the files
<code>data/demo/maps/castle*.py</code> as examples. It would be best
if you open up these files (in your text editor) when we mention them,
so that you can follow along more easily.

<h2>A very simple map</h2>

The file demo-castle-1.py contains a very simple map. This is what
the entire file looks like:

<pre>
# MAP DATA

# Version of the map file format
VERSION = 1

# Width and height of the map
WIDTH = 17
HEIGHT = 22

# Layout of map tiles

This is the minimum that a map file can have. Here's some more
details:

<ul>

<li>
VERSION gives the version number of the map file format - always set
this to 1.
</li>

<li>
WIDTH and HEIGHT are the width and height of the map.
</li>

<li>
The LAYOUT section contains one row of the map per line. Each tile in
that row is given as a number, which is the height of that tile. Tiles
are separated by one or more spaces. Tiles with height 0 won't be
drawn, and no units will be able to move into these spaces. 8 height
units is visually equal to one tile -- so a tile that has a height 8
higher than its neighbors will look like a cube. As a rule of thumb,
most units will have jump values in the range 6-8, which means that
they can move up/down 6-8 height units from one tile to the next.
</li>

</ul>

You can also see that you can add comments to your map files, which
might help you remember what you're up to.  This file is pretty
simple, so it probably doesn't need comments, but once we get to more
complicated maps you might see why you'd want comments.
<p>
If you run this map with <code>GalaxyMage.py -m castle-1</code>,
you'll see what it looks like: a flat field with a castle in the
middle (and a little void for a moat).
<p>
<img src="map-file-format-castle-1.png">
<p>
But it's a pretty boring map; everything is white. So let's spruce it
up a bit so that it looks much nicer.

<h2>Adding color to the map</h2>

In the file castle-2.py, we'll see how to add color. The first
new thing you should notice is the following chunk:

<pre>
# Tile properties
TILE_PROPERTIES = {
    'w': { 'color': (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0) },
    'g': { 'color': (0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1.0) },
    't': { 'color': (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0) },
    '':  { 'color': (0.5, 0.7, 0.5, 1.0) },
    }
</pre>

You'll also notice that some of the tiles in the LAYOUT section have
letters after the numbers, like this:

<pre>
14w 4g  4g  4g  4g  4g  4g  4g  14w
</pre>

This letter is a "tag" that tells the map loader which properties to
apply to the tile. It reads these properties out of the
TILE_PROPERTIES section. For instance, anything tagged with the letter
"w" will have a color (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0) -- basically, a white
color. Likewise, the "g" tag creates a grey tile and the "t" tag
creates a tan tile. Anything that doesn't have a tag gets a default
value from the last line -- the one that starts with '': . It turns
out that this is a green color.
<p>
A word about colors: the 4 values there are (red, green, blue, alpha),
all in the range 0.0 to 1.0. You should always set alpha to 1.0 for
now. Eventually this value might let you define translucent map tiles,
but for now it's not implemented correctly (and probably won't be for
a while, if ever.)
<p>
Though all the tags in this example are single characters, you can use
strings of multiple characters if you want. This might become more
useful when you get to more complicated maps.
<p>
Go ahead and run this map and see what it looks like.
<p>

<h3>Adding color variance</h3>

Now, onto castle-3.py, where we'll spruce things up just a bit
more. Nothing's changed here except tile properties, where you can see
that every tag has a new property defined:
<pre>
TILE_PROPERTIES = {
    'w': { 'color': (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0) }, 
    'g': { 'color': (0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0) }, 
    't': { 'color': (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0) }, 
    '':  { 'color': (0.5, 0.7, 0.5, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0) }, 
    }
</pre>
This adds some random variation to the colors of the tiles that have
that tag. Basically, each color component has a random amount
subtracted from the value specified in 'color'. So for our example,
the tiles tagged with "g" will now have color values randomly selected
from the range (0.55 - 0.6). The colorVar is set to 0.2 for the
default (green) tiles, so their color will vary a lot more than the
castle tiles. Note also that we didn't add a 'colorVar' property to
the 't' tag, so tiles tagged with 't' will have no variance.
<p>
<img src="map-file-format-castle-3.png">

<h2>Adding textures</h2>

Onto castle-4.py, where we make things look much nicer by adding
textures. This is really simple: we just add another new field to the
TILE_PROPERTIES structure:
<pre>
TILE_PROPERTIES = {
    'w': { 'color': (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0),
           'texture': 'stone' }, 
    'g': { 'color': (0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0),
           'texture': 'marble-slight' }, 
    't': { 'color': (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0),
           'texture': 'wood' }, 
    '':  { 'color': (0.5, 0.7, 0.5, 1.0),
           'colorVar': (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0),
           'texture': 'grass' }, 
    }
</pre>

These textures are loaded from the data/*/textures directories. Each
file is a 128x128 PNG image.  Feel free to make your own textures and
use them in your maps. It's recommended, but not required, that you
make textures in grayscale - that way you can add them to a map tile
of any color without it looking too weird.  Otherwise, the map tile
will get some of its color from the texture that is applied to it.
<p>

<h2>Advanced map-making</h2>

That's all you need to start making basic maps. The only other thing
that's supported -- but that I haven't covered yet -- is how to set
the heights of each tile corner individually.  I'll write a more
detailed explanation of that eventually, but for now you can
look at the final file, castle.py, to see how to do it.
<p>
<img src="map-file-format-castle-5.png">
<p>
castle.py also shows how you can define constants, like
<pre>
white = (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0)
</pre>

This makes the map file slightly easier to read. More importantly, if
you define and use the <code>white</code> constant for all your white
tiles, you can adjust the color in just one place and have that change
automatically applied to all white tiles.
