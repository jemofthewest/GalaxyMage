<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h2>Version 0.2.0</h2>

<h3>Content</h3>

The "adept", "squire", and "scout" classes have been replaced with six
new classes that will be considered our core classes: "fighter",
"defender", "rogue", "archer", "healer", and "mage". Stats of all
these classes have been tweaked. A few new abilities have been added
for the new classes.
<p>
A random map generator and random scenario generator have been added.
<p>
New "win" and "loss" music.

<h3>Battle Engine</h3>

Units can now wear weapons and armor. Some basic weapons and armor
have been added to the data/core/items directory. The sounds played
when attacking with a weapon now depend on the type of weapon (so bows
make an arrow noise, swords make a clangy noise, and so on.)
<p>
Ranged attacks can now be targeted up to 16 height-units up/down from
the unit's position. (The previous value was 8.)

<h3>User Interface</h3>

Scenarios can now be chosen from the GUI instead of only from the
command-line. After a battle is complete, GalaxyMage returns to the
GUI scenario chooser so that the player can pick another scenario to
play.
<p>
You can now cancel a unit's move if it has not yet acted. (Just press
the escape key until the unit returns to its old position.)
<p>
Preliminary joystick support added.
<p>
The camera behavior is now a bit better on maps with significant
height differences (units stay centered without the need to zoom in
and out).
<p>
The camera can now be rotated smoothly by right-clicking and draggins
left/right.
<p>
The highlights showing unit movement ranges have been changed from
green to cyan. This makes it a bit easier to see the movement ranges
on green grassy areas.
<p>
We now use linear filtering to smooth unit sprites when they are
viewed close-up.
<p>
Fix for a bug where the camera would oscillate wildly for players with
very low FPS.

<h3>AI</h3>

The AI has been improved significantly. It actually makes use of
special attacks, healing, and so on. It's currently a bit unoptimized,
so might take a bit of time in some circumstances. The AI now runs in
a separate thread. The battle engine is currently responsible for
displaying the actions taken by the AI. Previous scenarios have been
rebalanced to account for the stronger AI.

<h3>Translation</h3>

Infrastructure for translation has been added. A translation of
GalaxyMage into French is underway.

<h2>Version 0.1.2</h2>

<h3>Content</h3>

Added a new map and a scenario for that map. The map includes a
hill, ravine, and river.

<h3>Battle Engine</h3>

Dead units now disappear from the battlefield.

<h3>User Interface</h3>

The main window is now resizable.
<p>
After an action is complete, the camera focus remains on the unit for
a short period of time, to ensure that the player can see the effects
of the action.
<p>
Added keybinding: Home/End now rotate the map (in addition to
brackets), for users who do not have bracket keys on their keyboards.
<p>
Added mouse binding: the map can also be rotated by right-clicking and
dragging to the left or right.
<p>
Added keybinding: hit F12 to toggle fullscreen during
play. Unfortunately, this only works in Linux.
<p>
If a scenario isn't specified on the command-line, the scenario will
be chosen randomly.

<h3>Design Tools</h3>

Implemented a preliminary tool to make map-building easier.
<p>
Scenario designers can now set the sky color of their scenarios. If
left unset, it defaults to the fog color; if the fog color is also
unset, it defaults to a dark blue.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Added a lot more documentation for designers: an overview of all the
components of a GalaxyMage campaign, basic config file format
information, and a detailed tutorial on creating maps by hand.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

New "GM" icon.
<p>
Started using Python's built-in logging module. The old "-d"
command-line option has been replaced by "-v". A lot more system
information is now logged to the debug steam.
<p>
Fixed some graphics issues -- surface normals for the tops of map
squares now seem to be working properly for squares with non-zero
corner heights. Some mild performance improvements.

<h2>Version 0.1.1</h2>

Bug fix for crash that occurs on machines without sound cards
(pygame.mixer unable to initialize).

<h2>Version 0.1.0</h2>
